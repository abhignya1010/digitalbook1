This is my FRT Internship project....

# Project Statement:

cookbook, collection of recipes, instructions, and information about the preparation and serving of foods. At its best, a cookbook is also a chronicle and treasury of the fine art of cooking, an art whose masterpieces—created only to be consumed—would otherwise be lost.


# Project Description:

This recipe book project can be used throughout the semester or year when you have extra time in class or can be done for an entire week. You can make student print their recipe book or have them turn in a digital copy.
 It’s important to have all your favorite recipes organized in a place you can easily find them. You are going to go use the internet to start making a recipe book. You can use any source (food network app, Pinterest) but please only use recipes you would actually like to make, otherwise it is just a waste of time. You can put your recipe book on a google doc or a google slide. Make sure you use separate pages for each recipe. (Use page break if doing google doc or separate slides if using google slides.) You will be graded over the appearance, so your cookbook needs to be NEAT and ORGANIZED and must be in the order
